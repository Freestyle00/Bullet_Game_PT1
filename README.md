# Bullet_Game_PT1
Bullet game Prototype 1 is the first game i'm making, without copying an existing game and therefore I have to make my own logic and grafics and everything else.
The game is about dodging bullets with your ability to slow down time so expect me making it harder so that this ability will not be your Get-out-of-jail-card like in Boneworks
but your ability to use normaly when needed.

# What will be added
There is a kanban board set to public on which you can see current progress: https://github.com/users/Freestyle00/projects/1.

# How to compile
First you need some downloads from this site: https://flatredball.com/download/ the first one would be the Visual Studio 2019 download (Select C# as you neeed the C# compiler)

Second you need the .NET Framework 4.7.1 Developer Pack to be able to compile the game.

Third download the project from github and double click on the .sln then you will be able to compile the game from Visual Studio.
